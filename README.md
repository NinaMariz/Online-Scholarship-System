Brief Summary

The Improved Online Scholarship System was designed specifically for High School, Senior High School, and College students, aiming to enhance 
accessibility and convenience in their application process. While the existing system is functional, it lacks certain features crucial for a 
more streamlined and hassle-free experience. Recognizing this, the developers made the decision to enhance the current EBD Scholarship System 
of the Batangas City Government.

This initiative aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly contributing to Goal 4: Quality Education. By improving 
the scholarship system, the developers are actively supporting efforts to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all, promoting 
lifelong learning opportunities, and fostering a culture of innovation and excellence in education. The enhanced system aims to facilitate 
scholarship applications, ultimately making educational opportunities more accessible and aligned with global sustainability objectives.
